## Description
This weather dashboard allows users to search for cities from around the world and view detailed weather information. When searching for a city, the dashboard will display the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. The website also maintains a search history, allowing users to revisit searched cities. Additionally, users can manage their search history by deleting individual entries for a clean and organized experience.
